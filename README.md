# Cryptocurrency Clustering Project
## Overview
In this project, we will be using unsupervised learning techniques to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their performance in different time periods. We will be using K-means clustering algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize the clusters.

## Dataset
The provided CSV file contains the price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.

## Steps
Import the data (provided in the starter code).
Prepare the data (provided in the starter code).
Find the best value for k by using the original data.
Cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means by using the original data.
Optimize the clusters with principal component analysis.
Find the best value for k by using the PCA data.
Cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means by using the PCA data.
Visualize and compare the results.
